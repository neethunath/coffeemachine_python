# Coffee Machine Project

## Project Overview

The Coffee Machine project is a Python-based program that allows users to purchase different types of coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino) while managing resources such as water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and money. The program runs in a loop, enabling users to perform multiple actions until they decide to exit.
This project is a part of Python Developer course on the [Hyperskill platform](https://hyperskill.org)

## Code Functionality

The implementation provides the following features:

1. **Coffee Purchase**: Users can purchase three types of coffee:
   - **Espresso**: Requires 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans ($4).
   - **Latte**: Requires 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans ($7).
   - **Cappuccino**: Requires 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee beans ($6).

2. **Resource Management**: Users can check the remaining resources (water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and money).

3. **Fill Resources**: Users can add more water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups to the machine.

4. **Money Withdrawal**: Users can take all the money from the machine.

5. **Exit Option**: The program terminates when the user types "exit".
